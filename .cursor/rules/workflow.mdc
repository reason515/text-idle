# Implementation Workflow

## Output Order

1. Brief clarification (problem, expected behavior)
2. Scenario summary (normal flow, edge cases)
3. Implementation
4. **Tests** (unit + E2E if applicable)
5. Key notes

## Prohibited

- Non-ASCII in code
- Skipping tests for core logic
- Using `&&` in PowerShell (use `;` instead)
- Overengineering, placeholder logic

## E2E Definition

- E2E = full UI flow through browser to backend
- Location: `e2e/browser/`
- Use Playwright
