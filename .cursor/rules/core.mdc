# Text Idle - Core Rules (MANDATORY)

**Before ANY implementation, you MUST:**

1. [ ] Read these rules fully
2. [ ] Confirm: Will I write tests? (Unit + E2E per feature)
3. [ ] Confirm: Will ALL code use ASCII only? (No Chinese in source)

---

## ASCII Encoding (STRICT - No Exceptions)

- Source code, comments, logs, tests, string literals, identifiers: **ASCII ONLY**
- Documentation (e.g. docs/*.md) may use non-ASCII
- If you see non-ASCII in code you edit: translate to English

---

## Definition of Done

A task is NOT complete until:

- Core logic has **unit tests**
- Features with UI have **E2E tests** in `e2e/browser/`
- All code is ASCII-only

---

## TDD / Test Requirements

- Prefer tests before implementation
- Unit tests: `frontend/src/**/*.spec.js` (Vitest)
- E2E tests: `e2e/browser/*.spec.js` (Playwright)
- Run: `npm run test` (frontend), `npm run e2e` (root)
