# Text Idle - Game Design Rules

## Idle Game Principle (MANDATORY)

This is an **idle/placement game**. During combat, the player **cannot control** the battle in real-time.

- **Player influence**: Only through **pre-configured tactics** (e.g., skill priority, target selection, AI behavior)
- **Prohibited**: Design assumptions that imply real-time player control (e.g., "for strategy prediction during battle", "for in-combat decision-making")
- **Correct**: Design for post-combat analysis, tactic tuning, and build optimization based on combat logs and statistics

## Turn-Based Combat (MANDATORY)

The game uses **turn-based combat**, not real-time. All mechanics must be expressed in **turns/rounds**, never in real-time units.

### Prohibited

- Seconds (秒), minutes (分钟), hours (小时) for combat or resource mechanics
- Per-second rates (e.g. "10 per second", "每秒 10 点")
- Real-time cooldowns (e.g. "3 second CD")

### Required

- Use **turn** (回合) or **round** for all combat timing
- Resource recovery: "per turn" (每回合), not "per second"
- Cooldowns: "X turns" (X 回合), not "X seconds"
- Rate-based mechanics: "X per turn" (每回合 X 点)

### Examples

| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| 每秒恢复 10 能量 | 每回合恢复 10 能量 |
| 3 second cooldown | 3 回合冷却 |
| 10 damage per second | 10 伤害/回合 |
